This is a webcam spoofer extension for browsers. It allows you to channel a video or image into your webcam stream instead of your actual webcam footage.
It leverages proxies and modifies the prototype of natively provided classes in the browser to achieve this behaviour.

Feel free to look into the source code and add more controls as you need. I might do a rehaul in the future to make it more user friendly.
